/*
 * While the potential for uses of persistent property sets is not fully tapped, there are  
 * currently two primary uses:
 *		Storing summary information with an object such as a document
 *		Transferring property data between objects
 *
 * COM property sets were designed to store data that is suited to representation as a moderately 
 * sized collection of fine-grained values. Data sets that are too large for this to be feasible 
 * should be broken into separate streams, storages, and/or property sets. The COM property set 
 * data format was not meant to provide a substitute for a database of many tiny objects.
 *
 * COM provides implementations of the property set interfaces for various objects, along with 
 * three helper functions. The following section describes some performance characteristics of 
 * these implementations.
 *
 * IPropertySetStorage–Compound File Implementation
 * The compound file implementation, which provides the IStorage and IStream interfaces, also 
 * provides the IPropertySetStorage and IPropertyStorage interfaces. Given a compound file 
 * implementation of IStorage, the IPropertySetStorage interface can be obtained by calling 
 * IUnknown::QueryInterface.
 *
 * IPropertySetStorage–NTFS File System Implementation
 * The IPropertySetStorage and IPropertyStorage interfaces can also be obtained for NTFS files 
 * that are not compound files. Therefore, it is possible to obtain these interfaces for all 
 * files on an NTFS volume.
 *
 * IPropertySetStorage–Stand-alone Implementation
 * When this implementation of IPropertySetStorage and IPropertyStorage is instantiated, it is 
 * given a pointer to an object that supports the IStorage interface. It then manipulates 
 * property set storages within that storage object. Thus, it is possible to access and 
 * manipulate property sets on any object that supports .
 *
 * IPropertySetStorage Implementation Considerations
 * There are several issues to consider in providing an implementation of the IPropertySetStorage 
 * interface.

 * should always be a multiple of four.
 * For example, an empty section, that is, one with zero properties in it, would have a byte

/*
 * Following the Count of Properties property set value is an array of Property Identifiers/
 * Offset Pairs property set values. Property Identifiers are 32-bit values that uniquely 
 * identify a property within a section. The Offset Pairs indicate the distance from the start of 
 * the section to the start of the property Type/Value Pair. Because the offsets are relative to 
 * the section, sections can be copied as an array of bytes.
 * Property identifiers are not sorted in any particular order. Properties can be omitted from 
 * the stored property set; readers must not rely on a specific order or range of property 
 * identifiers.
 * 
 * The actual properties follow the table of Property Identifiers/Offset Pairs property set 
 * values. Each property is stored as a DWORD, followed by the data type value.
 * Type indicators and their associated values are described in the PROPVARIANT structure.
 * All Type/Value pairs must begin on a 32-bit boundary. Thus, values may be followed with null 
 * bytes to align the subsequent pair on a 32-bit boundary.
 * The following example code calculates how many bytes are required to align on a 32-bit 
 * boundary, given a count of bytes.
 *  cbAdd = (((cbCurrent + 3) >> 2) << 2) - cbCurrent ;
 *
 *  Within a vector of values, each repetition of a simple scalar value smaller than 32 bits must 
 *  align with its natural alignment rather than with a 32-bit alignment. In practice, this is 
 *  only significant for types VT_UI1, VT_UI2, VT_I2, and VT_BOOL (which have one-byte or two-
 *  byte natural alignment). All other types have four-byte natural alignment. Some types, for 
 *  example, VT_R8, actually have 8-byte natural alignment, but are stored as if they have four-
 *  byte alignment.
 *
 *  A property value with type indicator VT_I2 | VT_VECTOR would include:
 *		A DWORD element count.
 *		A sequence of packed two-byte integers with no null padding between them.
 *
 * A property value of type identifier VT_LPSTR | VT_VECTOR would include:
 *		A DWORD element count (DWORD cElems).
 *		A sequence of strings (char rgch[]), each preceded by a length-count DWORD and possibly 
 * followed by null padding to round to a 32-bit boundary.
