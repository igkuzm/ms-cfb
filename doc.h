/*
 * [MS-DOC]: Word (.doc) Binary File Format
 * Specifies the Word (.doc) Binary File Format, which is the binary file format used by Microsoft 
 * Word 97, Microsoft Word 2000, Microsoft Word 2002, and Microsoft Office Word 2003.
 *
 * Characters 
 * The fundamental unit of a Word binary file is a character. This includes visual characters such as 
 * letters, numbers, and punctuation. It also includes formatting characters such as paragraph marks, 
 * end of cell marks, line breaks, or section breaks. Finally, it includes anchor characters such as 
 * footnote reference characters, picture anchors, and comment anchors. 
 * Characters are indexed by their zero-based Character Position, or CP.  
 * 
 * PLCs 
 * Many features of the Word Binary File Format pertain to a range of CPs. For example, 
 * a bookmark is a range of CPs that is named by the document author. As another 
 * example, a field is made up of three control characters with ranges of arbitrary document content 
 * between them. 
 * The Word Binary File Format uses a PLC structure to specify these and other kinds of 
 * ranges of CPs. A PLC is simply a mapping from CPs to other, arbitrary data. 
 *
 * Formatting 
 * The formatting of characters, paragraphs, sections, tables, and pictures is specified as a set of 
 * differences in formatting from the default formatting for these objects. Modifications to individual 
 * properties are expressed using a Prl. A Prl is a Single Property Modifier, or Sprm, and an operand 
 * that specifies the new value for the property. Each property has (at least) one unique Sprm that 
 * modifies 
 * it. For example, sprmCFBold modifies the bold formatting of text, and sprmPDxaLeft modifies the 
 * logical left indent of a paragraph. 
 * The final set of properties for text, paragraphs, and tables comes from a hierarchy of styles and 
 * from Prl elements applied directly (for example, by the user selecting some text and clicking the 
 * Bold button in the user interface). Styles allow complex sets of properties to be specified in a 
 * compact way. 
 * They also allow the user to change the appearance of a document without visiting every place in the 
 * document where a change is necessary. The style sheet for a document is specified by a STSH. 
 *
 * Tables 
 * A table consists of a set of paragraphs that has a particular set of properties applied. There are 
 * special characters that denote the ends of table cells and the ends of table rows, but there are no 
 * characters to denote the beginning of a table cell or the end of the table as a whole. Tables can be 
 * nested inside other tables.
 * 
 * Pictures 
 * Pictures in the Word Binary File format can be either inline or floating. An inline picture is 
 * represented by a character whose Unicode value is 0x0001 and has sprmCFSpec applied with a value of 
 * 1 and sprmCPicLocation applied to specify the location of the picture data. A floating picture is 
 * represented by an anchor character with a Unicode value of 0x0008 with sprmCFSpec applied with a 
 * value of 1. In addition, floating pictures are referenced by a PlcfSpa structure which contains 
 * additional data about the picture. A floating picture can appear anywhere on the same page as its 
 * anchor. The document author can choose to have the floating picture rearrange the text in various 
 * ways or to leave the text as is.
 *
 * The FIB 
 * The main stream of the Word Binary File Format begins with a File Information Block, or FIB. The FIB 
 * specifies the locations of all other data in the file. The locations are specified by a pair of 
 * integers, the first of which specifies the location and the second of which specifies the size. 
 * These integers appear in substructures of the FIB such as the FibRgFcLcb97. The location names are 
 * prefixed with fc; the size names are prefixed with lcb.
 *
 * Byte Ordering 
 * Some computer architectures number bytes in a binary word from left to right, which is referred to 
 * as big-endian. The bit diagram for this documentation is big-endian. Other architectures number the 
 * bytes in a binary word from right to left, which is referred to as little-endian. The underlying 
 * file format enumerations, objects, and records are little-endian
