/*
 * [MS-DOC]: Word (.doc) Binary File Format
 * Specifies the Word (.doc) Binary File Format, which is the binary file format used by Microsoft 
 * Word 97, Microsoft Word 2000, Microsoft Word 2002, and Microsoft Office Word 2003.
 *
 * Characters 
 * The fundamental unit of a Word binary file is a character. This includes visual characters such as 
 * letters, numbers, and punctuation. It also includes formatting characters such as paragraph marks, 
 * end of cell marks, line breaks, or section breaks. Finally, it includes anchor characters such as 
 * footnote reference characters, picture anchors, and comment anchors. 
 * Characters are indexed by their zero-based Character Position, or CP.  
 * 
 * PLCs 
 * Many features of the Word Binary File Format pertain to a range of CPs. For example, 
 * a bookmark is a range of CPs that is named by the document author. As another 
 * example, a field is made up of three control characters with ranges of arbitrary document content 
 * between them. 
 * The Word Binary File Format uses a PLC structure to specify these and other kinds of 
 * ranges of CPs. A PLC is simply a mapping from CPs to other, arbitrary data. 
 *
 * Formatting 
 * The formatting of characters, paragraphs, sections, tables, and pictures is specified as a set of 
 * differences in formatting from the default formatting for these objects. Modifications to individual 
 * properties are expressed using a Prl. A Prl is a Single Property Modifier, or Sprm, and an operand 
 * that specifies the new value for the property. Each property has (at least) one unique Sprm that 
 * modifies 
 * it. For example, sprmCFBold modifies the bold formatting of text, and sprmPDxaLeft modifies the 
 * logical left indent of a paragraph. 
 * The final set of properties for text, paragraphs, and tables comes from a hierarchy of styles and 
 * from Prl elements applied directly (for example, by the user selecting some text and clicking the 
 * Bold button in the user interface). Styles allow complex sets of properties to be specified in a 
 * compact way. 
 * They also allow the user to change the appearance of a document without visiting every place in the 
 * document where a change is necessary. The style sheet for a document is specified by a STSH. 
 *
 * Tables 
 * A table consists of a set of paragraphs that has a particular set of properties applied. There are 
 * special characters that denote the ends of table cells and the ends of table rows, but there are no 
 * characters to denote the beginning of a table cell or the end of the table as a whole. Tables can be 
 * nested inside other tables.
 * 
 * Pictures 
 * Pictures in the Word Binary File format can be either inline or floating. An inline picture is 
 * represented by a character whose Unicode value is 0x0001 and has sprmCFSpec applied with a value of 
 * 1 and sprmCPicLocation applied to specify the location of the picture data. A floating picture is 
 * represented by an anchor character with a Unicode value of 0x0008 with sprmCFSpec applied with a 
 * value of 1. In addition, floating pictures are referenced by a PlcfSpa structure which contains 
 * additional data about the picture. A floating picture can appear anywhere on the same page as its 
 * anchor. The document author can choose to have the floating picture rearrange the text in various 
 * ways or to leave the text as is.
 *
 * The FIB 
 * The main stream of the Word Binary File Format begins with a File Information Block, or FIB. The FIB 
 * specifies the locations of all other data in the file. The locations are specified by a pair of 
 * integers, the first of which specifies the location and the second of which specifies the size. 
 * These integers appear in substructures of the FIB such as the FibRgFcLcb97. The location names are 
 * prefixed with fc; the size names are prefixed with lcb.
 *
 * Byte Ordering 
 * Some computer architectures number bytes in a binary word from left to right, which is referred to 
 * as big-endian. The bit diagram for this documentation is big-endian. Other architectures number the 
 * bytes in a binary word from right to left, which is referred to as little-endian. The underlying 
 * file format enumerations, objects, and records are little-endian

 * How to read the FIB
 * The Fib structure is located at offset 0 of the WordDocument Stream. Given the variable size of
 * the Fib, the proper way to load it is the following:
 * 1.  Set all bytes of the in-memory version of the Fib being used to 0. It is recommended to use 
 *     the largest version of the Fib structure as the in-memory version.
 * 2.  Read the entire FibBase, which MUST be present and has fixed size.
 * 3.  Read Fib.csw.
 * 4.  Read the minimum of Fib.csw * 2 bytes and the size, in bytes, of the in-memory version of 
 *     FibRgW97 into FibRgW97.
 * 5.  If the application expects fewer bytes than indicated by Fib.csw, advance by the difference
 *     thereby skipping the unknown portion of FibRgW97.
 * 6.  Read Fib.cslw.
 * 7.  Read the minimum of Fib.cslw * 4 bytes and the size, in bytes, of the in-memory version of
 *     FibRgLw97 into FibRgLw97.
 * 8.  If the application expects fewer bytes than indicated by Fib.cslw, advance by the 
 *     difference thereby skipping the unknown portion of FibRgLw97.
 * 9.  Read Fib.cbRgFcLcb.
 * 10. Read the minimum of Fib.cbRgFcLcb * 8 bytes and the size, in bytes, of the in-memory 
 *     version of FibRgFcLcb into FibRgFcLcb.
 * 11. If the application expects fewer bytes than indicated by Fib.cbRgFcLcb, advance by the 
 *     difference, thereby skipping the unknown portion of FibRgFcLcb.
 * 12. Read Fib.cswNew.
 * 13. Read the minimum of Fib.cswNew * 2 bytes and the size, in bytes, of the in-memory version 
 *     of FibRgCswNew into FibRgCswNew.

/*
 * Retrieving Text
 * The following algorithm specifies how to find the text at a particular character position 
 * (cp). Negative character positions are not valid.
 * 1. Read the FIB from offset zero in the WordDocument Stream.
 * 2. All versions of the FIB contain exactly one FibRgFcLcb97, though it can be nested in a 
 * larger structure. FibRgFcLcb97.fcClx specifies the offset in the Table Stream of a Clx. 
 * FibRgFcLcb97.lcbClx specifies the size, in bytes, of that Clx. Read the Clx from the Table 
 * Stream.
 * 3. The Clx contains a Pcdt, and the Pcdt contains a PlcPcd. Find the largest i such that 
 * PlcPcd.aCp[i] ‚â§ cp. As with all Plcs, the elements of PlcPcd.aCp are sorted in ascending 
 * order. Recall from the definition of a Plc that the aCp array has one more element than the 
 * aPcd array. Thus, if the last element of PlcPcd.aCp is less than or equal to cp, cp is 
 * outside the range of valid character positions in this document.
 * 4. PlcPcd.aPcd[i] is a Pcd. Pcd.fc is an FcCompressed that specifies the location in the 
 * WordDocument Stream of the text at character position PlcPcd.aCp[i].
 * 5. If FcCompressed.fCompressed is zero, the character at position cp is a 16-bit Unicode 
 * character at offset FcCompressed.fc + 2(cp - PlcPcd.aCp[i]) in the WordDocument Stream. This 
 * is to say that the text at character position PlcPcd.aCP[i] begins at offset FcCompressed.fc 
 * in the WordDocument Stream and each character occupies two bytes.
 * 6. If FcCompressed.fCompressed is 1, the character at position cp is an 8-bit ANSI character 
 * at offset (FcCompressed.fc / 2) + (cp - PlcPcd.aCp[i]) in the WordDocument Stream, unless it 
 * is one of the special values in the table defined in the description of FcCompressed.fc. This 
 * is to say that the text at character position PlcPcd.aCP[i] begins at offset FcCompressed.
 * fc / 2 in the WordDocument Stream and each character occupies one byte.
 *
 * Determining Paragraph Boundaries
 * This section specifies how to find the beginning and end character positions of the paragraph 
 * that contains a given character position. The character at the end character position of a 
 * paragraph MUST be a paragraph mark, an end-of-section character, a cell mark, or a TTP mark 
 * (See Overview of Tables). Negative character positions are not valid.
 * To find the character position of the first character in the paragraph that contains a given 
 * character position cp:
 * 1. Follow the algorithm from Retrieving Text up to and including step 3 to find i. Also 
 * remember the FibRgFcLcb97 and PlcPcd found in step 1 of Retrieving Text. If the algorithm 
 * from Retrieving Text specifies that cp is invalid, leave the algorithm.
 * 2. Let pcd be PlcPcd.aPcd[i].
 * 3. Let fcPcd be Pcd.fc.fc. Let fc be fcPcd + 2(cp ‚Äì PlcPcd.aCp[i]). If Pcd.fc.fCompressed is 
 * one, set fc to fc / 2, and set fcPcd to fcPcd/2.
 * 4. Read a PlcBtePapx at offset FibRgFcLcb97.fcPlcfBtePapx in the Table Stream, and of size 
 * FibRgFcLcb97.lcbPlcfBtePapx. Let fcLast be the last element of plcbtePapx.aFc. If fcLast is 
 * less than or equal to fc, examine fcPcd. If fcLast is less than fcPcd, go to step 8. 
 * Otherwise, set fc to fcLast. If Pcd.fc.fCompressed is one, set fcLast to fcLast / 2. Set 
 * fcFirst to fcLast and go to step 7.
 * 5. Find the largest j such that plcbtePapx.aFc[j] ‚â§ fc. Read a PapxFkp at offset 
 * aPnBtePapx[j].pn *512 in the WordDocument Stream.
 * 6. Find the largest k such that PapxFkp.rgfc[k] ‚â§ fc. If the last element of PapxFkp.rgfc is 
 * less than or equal to fc, then cp is outside the range of character positions in this 
 * document, and is not valid. Let fcFirst be PapxFkp.rgfc[k].
 * 7. If fcFirst is greater than fcPcd, then let dfc be (fcFirst ‚Äì fcPcd). If Pcd.fc.fCompressed 
 * is zero, then set dfc to dfc / 2. The first character of the paragraph is at character 
 * position PlcPcd.aCp[i] + dfc. Leave the algorithm.
 * 8. If PlcPcd.aCp[i] is 0, then the first character of the paragraph is at character position 
 * 0. Leave the algorithm.
 * 9. Set cp to PlcPcd.aCp[i]. Set i to i - 1. Go to step 2.
 *
 * To find the character position of the last character in the paragraph that contains a given 
 * character position cp:
 * 1. Follow the algorithm from Retrieving Text up to and including step 3 to find i. Also 
 * remember the FibRgFcLcb97, and PlcPcd found in step 1 of Retrieving Text. If the algorithm 
 * from Retrieving Text specifies that cp is invalid, leave the algorithm.
 * 2. Let pcd be PlcPcd.aPcd[i].
 * 3. Let fcPcd be Pcd.fc.fc. Let fc be fcPcd + 2(cp ‚Äì PlcPcd.aCp[i]). Let fcMac be fcPcd + 
 * 2(PlcPcd.aCp[i+1] - PlcPcd.aCp[i]). If Pcd.fc.fCompressed is one, set fc to fc/2, set fcPcd 
 * to fcPcd /2 and set fcMac to fcMac/2.
 * 4. Read a PlcBtePapx at offset FibRgFcLcb97.fcPlcfBtePapx in the Table Stream, and of size 
 * FibRgFcLcb97.lcbPlcfBtePapx. Then find the largest j such that plcbtePapx.aFc[j] ‚â§ fc. If the 
 * last element of plcbtePapx.aFc is less than or equal to fc, then go to step 7. Read a PapxFkp 
 * at offset aPnBtePapx[j].pn *512 in the WordDocument Stream.
 * 5. Find largest k such that PapxFkp.rgfc[k] ‚â§ fc. If the last element of PapxFkp.rgfc is less 
 * than or equal to fc, then cp is outside the range of character positions in this document, 
 * and is not valid. Let fcLim be PapxFkp.rgfc[k+1].
 * 6. If fcLim ‚â§ fcMac, then let dfc be (fcLim ‚Äì fcPcd). If Pcd.fc.fCompressed is zero, then set 
 * dfc to dfc / 2. The last character of the paragraph is at character position PlcPcd.aCp[i] + 
 * dfc ‚Äì 1. Leave the algorithm.
 * 7. Set cp to PlcPcd.aCp[i+1]. Set i to i + 1. Go to step 2.
